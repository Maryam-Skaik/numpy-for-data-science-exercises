## 📌 About This Repository

This repository is a structured collection of **real-time coding exercises** created while studying NumPy for data science applications.

The goal is to:
- Master NumPy as the core numerical computing library in Python
- Understand how NumPy arrays work internally
- Apply NumPy operations efficiently for data analysis and scientific computing
- Build strong foundations required for Machine Learning and Data Science workflows

All code is written and organized by me while following the course content.
