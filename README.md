## 📌 About This Repository

This repository is a **concept-organized NumPy practice notebook**, written entirely by me while learning and experimenting with NumPy concepts used in data science and scientific computing.

The focus is on:

- Understanding NumPy arrays and operations deeply
- Writing clear, readable, and well-commented code
- Practicing core NumPy APIs used in data analysis and ML pipelines
- Building a strong foundation before moving to Pandas, ML, and AI workflows

All examples are implemented as **plain Python scripts** to emphasize core NumPy behavior without abstractions.

## 🧠 Learning Objectives

By working through this repository, I practiced:

- Creating and manipulating NumPy arrays (1D, 2D, 3D)
- Understanding shape, dimension, size, and data types
- Performing array indexing, slicing, and boolean masking
- Applying vectorized operations and broadcasting
- Using NumPy’s random module for simulations
- Working with identity, diagonal, and transpose operations
- Applying aggregation and logical functions
- Writing NumPy code suitable for real-world data science tasks

### Folder Design Principles

- **Numbered files** reflect learning order
- **Each file focuses on a single concept**
- **Expected outputs are preserved as comments**
- Code is intentionally explicit and beginner-friendly
